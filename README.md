# neetlisp - A Lisp dialect for the JVM

# What?
Neetlisp is a Lisp dialect running on the Java Virtual Machine. Well, I think
it is closer to clojure than to Lisp.

# Why?
There's clojure, right? Well, neetlisp is just a proof of concept. I just wanted
to check out if I can build a bytecode compiling Lisp for the JVM. 

# State?
Somewhere between alpha and beta, there's a lot of stuff missing.

# How?
Clone from github and run ant. This will open up the Java SWING neetlisp REPL.

# REPL
Keybindings:

* C-Enter : eval
* C-Escape : clear input
* C-Up : History browse up
* C-Down : History browse down
* C-Backspace : Clear output
* C-+ : Increase font size
* C-- : Decrease font size
* C-l : insert lambda symbol

# Api

This is a dump of all fn docs. Work in progress, some docs missing, lot of
api functions missing.
