# What?
Neetlisp is a Lisp dialect (Lisp-1) running on the Java Virtual Machine. Well, I think
it is closer to clojure than to Lisp.

# Why?
There's clojure, right? Well, neetlisp is just a proof of concept. I just wanted
to check out if I can build a bytecode compiling Lisp for the JVM. 

# State?
Somewhere between alpha and beta, there's a lot of stuff missing.

# How?
Clone from github and run ant. This will open up the Java SWING neetlisp REPL. You may also
have a look at src/neetlisp/nlsp for some neetlisp code.

# Features?
There's some hardcore coding action going on to make neetlisp feature complete.
What I got so far is:

* Neat REPL with rainbow-braces
* Reader macros, macros, fns
* basic sequence stuff
* lazy sequences (not 100% complete, about 20% I think)
* Unoptimized bytecode compilation
* Lexical scoping (closures)
* Very basic SWANK implementation (emax-rex) with just connect and eval

Missing/TODO/thoughts:

* loop/recur, tail-calls, lazy-seq
* Improved sequence implementation (Java-side and nlsp-api)
* More sanity checks
* Optimizing compiler
* Java interop?
* More API stuff
* Maps and sets
* Improve SWANK
* Create neetlisp-mode
* More detailed doc-strings
* Code cleanups (especially the compiler section)
* ...

# REPL
Keybindings:

* C-Enter : eval
* C-Escape : clear input
* C-Up : History browse up
* C-Down : History browse down
* C-Backspace : Clear output
* C-+ : Increase font size
* C-- : Decrease font size
* C-l : insert lambda symbol
